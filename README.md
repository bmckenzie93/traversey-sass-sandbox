In this sandbox I will be going over how to use sass again to sharpen my sass skills and knowledge. I have used it in a previous project but I expext to learn how to use it better in this course. So far I have learned how to use NPM to install a sass compiler - as apposed to using the VS code extension live sass compiler (incase I am ever using a differant text editor).

We went over basic nesting and stylesheet partials. I learned to use an underscore as the first charactor for partial stylesheet names to prevent sass from creating a new compiled css file.

//Inheritance and Contrast
I learned that in sass you can use the % syntax to create styling that can be extended upon in other areas using the @extend syntax. For example the core styleing of a button can be done with %btn-shared, and then for the differant versions of the button you can use @extend %btn-shared to add on the specific styles for each one.
