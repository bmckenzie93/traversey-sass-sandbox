In this sandbox I will be going over how to use sass again to sharpen my sass skills and knowledge. I have used it in a previous project but I expext to learn how to use it better in this course. So far I have learned how to use NPM to install a sass compiler - as apposed to using the VS code extension live sass compiler (incase I am ever using a differant text editor).

We went over basic nesting and stylesheet partials. I learned to use an underscore as the first charactor for partial stylesheet names to prevent sass from creating a new compiled css file.
